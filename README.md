# p-project
In a fun and educational approach, our project aims to raise your awareness of future issues in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.
Our group took part in the "NSI Trophies", an IT competition. Our project, called "Projet P", was carried out in groups of three. Our work was voted best project in the Terminale de Nouvelle-Aquitaine.
